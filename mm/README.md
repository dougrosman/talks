On Panopto's captions... (this also goes for YouTube's auto-captioning, Google Meet's auto-captioning (which I believe is the same as Google's, for Zoom's autocaptioning, etc.)

Auto-captioning services are pretty commonplace for a lot of video streaming platforms, and while they're pretty good like 95% of the time, that 5% of errors can sort of make the whole thing fall apart.

When you hit the CC button, sometimes the service explicitly states whether the captions are auto-generated (like YouTube), but even though, we don't really know what that means. Like, we understand a computer is doing it, but how is it deciding how to caption? Language models are trained on enormous data sets over long periods of time on expensive hardware--it's not trivial to keep updating these language models to incorporate the way our language changes
