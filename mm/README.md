On Panopto's captions... (this also goes for YouTube's auto-captioning, Google Meet's auto-captioning (which I believe is the same as Google's, for Zoom's autocaptioning, etc.)

Auto-captioning services are pretty commonplace for a lot of video streaming platforms, and while they're pretty good like 95% of the time, that 5% of errors can sort of make the whole thing fall apart.

When you hit the CC button, sometimes the service explicitly states whether the captions are auto-generated (like YouTube), but even though, we don't really know what that means. Like, we understand a computer is doing it, but how is it deciding how to caption? Language models are trained on enormous data sets over long periods of time on expensive hardware--it's not trivial to keep updating these language models to incorporate the way our language changes. There are so many nuances to the way we speak--the words we use, the ways we pronounce things--there's no way for an AI to keep up.

Auto captioning presents an interesting confluence of two problems. You always have to be wary of automated systems doing two things at once. There are two models at play: an audio model, trained to identify spoken human speech, and a language model, trained to make sense out of words in order to string sentences together. No matter how good the language model is, it can't account for all the different accents that the audio model has to deal with. In this documentary, there are people speaking with an English accent at one point, and I found the captioning more less accurate for those people.

And then later on in the video, there's a Mandarain speaker, and the AI attempts to interpret the language as English. The results are absurd, hilariously bad, and a stark reminder of how unhelpful these things can be.

"Machine-generated captioning produces captions very quickly. Typically, captions can be created in about one-quarter of the total video length. For example, an hour-long video could be captioned using ASR in approximately 15 minutes.

ASR captions are typically 70-75% accurate depending on the audio quality in the recording. As a result, machine-generated captions are primarily intended to enable inside-video search, and by default, they aren’t added to the video as closed captions. Instead, the text is stored in the video platform’s database for use with the video search engine.

Of course, ASR also provides a starting point from which people can manually create 100% accurate captions. In video platforms like Panopto, text generated by ASR can be added to the video as closed captions, which people can then edit."
